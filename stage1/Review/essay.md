# Single-cell Genomics: A stepping stone for future immunology discoveries

## Immunology
Immune system is the body's defense mechanism to detect and act against abnormalities in cell, invading pathogens. This defence mechanism is a complex network with multiple components communicating at various stages through various means. Prevention and progression of the disease is based on the immune system, hence functional understanding of immune system becomes vital. Immunology, the study of immune system has long focussed efforts to characterize and elucidate functions of various components of the immune system. This deeper understanding imparts the possibility of harnessing and manipulating the therapeutic potential of immunity. 
## Single-cell genomics for Immunology
Since the $19^{th}$ centuary with the efforts of Ilya Mechnikov,  classification or categorization of components of immune system based on their mopphology and functions has been the process to characterize immune system. With advances in technologies like FACS, NGS, Mass spectometry features like the molecular markers, spatial organization and relationship to cohabiting cells within tissues were associated to cell types. These efforts were based on the notion that a differentiated cell acquires certain molecular determinants that dictates it's functional state. Studies has concluded that cellular identity is highly versatile and is dependent on the tissue and  micro environments. <br>
Advances in the field single-cell genomics has made it applicable to immunology thereby promising great and fundamental inferences surpassing the previous setbacks. Celltypes that were so long considered as homogenous, like hematopoietic progenitor populations has been found to be functionally heterogenous through single-cell studies. The dicovery of disease associated microglia which interacts with the plaques in Alzheimer's disease shows the power if single-cell genomics in bringing out the distinction between subset of cells in the immune system. To harness the capability of single-cell thechnologies, both the experimental and computational approaches has to be well designed. Combining technology advancements in both the experimental and computational methods improves the scope of single-cell genomics from just being a transcriptional snapshot to producing spatial and temporal insights. <br>
## Conclusion
Single-cell genomics is a potential molecular microscope which has effectively differentiated and characterzied subtypes of cells, which were previously considered homogeneous like the ICL1-3, Hematopoietic stem cells and also the identification of disease associate microglia (DAM).
With the lowering experimental costs and improved computational efficiency, the authors believe that the deployment of single-cell genomics in translational immunology would result in improved patient diagnosis, drug respose prediction and more precise immunotherapy.
